					<h1>Testing and Packaging JS:</h1>
					<h3>JavaScript's final frontier</h3>
					<p>
						<small>Created by <a href="http://blog.codeartgames.com">Shawn Campbell</a> / <a href="http://twitter.com/jaegerpicker">@jaegerpicker</a></small>

					<h2>Who am I?</h2>
					<p>
						I'm Shawn Campbell, I've been a software engineer for the last 15 years. I've mostly worked on web applications but mobile and desktop applications
						also. I work at <a href="http://www.cashstar.com">CashStar</a> here in Portland, ME. I'm new to Maine since September 2013 and loving it so far.
						I love working with python but have used Objective-C, Java, C#, ruby, GoLang, C/C++, and Groovy professional in the past but more than any language
						I've always worked with JavaScript.
					</p>
				</section>

						<h2>Let's bravefully go where few have gone before</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Packaging? What for and why</h2>
						<p>
							In this presentation I refer to two types of packaging. Using a package management to control control dependencies and building your app. There are two
							important types of libraries to worry about managing in web applications. Server side or development time libraries and client side or web app dependencies.
							Development libraries are typically used for unit testing, JS minification, JS cancatenation, or css(less/sass) complilation. Client side libs are things
							like backbone.js, ember.js, or underscore.js.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Unit Testing</h2>
						<p>
							Our client side javascript apps are becoming more and more complicated. Server-side developers have long placed a huge importance on automated unit testing.
							Often going as far as to break builds if the tests do not all pass, yet client side unit testing remains much less common. Testing our code should be required
							not optional, even the client side code.
						</p>

						<h2>Task runners</h2>
						<p>
							JavaScript task runners are useful JS files that help to automate common development and server side tasks. We'll cover two options here, Grunt and Gulp.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2><a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt.js</a> </h2>
						<p>
							Grunt is the most popular and most used task runner around today. Lots of plugins and a ton of examples on the internet. It's based on defining tasks and
							and using various node libraries to automate tasks.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2><a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp.js</a></h2>
						<p>
							Gulp is a new and popular task runner. It's a based on node.js streams and code-over-configuration and aims to be simpliarer and quicker to use than Grunt.
							It's still very new and there are vastly fewer examples and plugins available however.
						</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Types of tasks</h2>
					<p>
						I usually define 5 different tasks:
						<ol>
							<li>Build</li>
							<li>server</li>
							<li>clean</li>
							<li>test</li>
							<li>test ci</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Build</h2>
					<p>
						This task typically will minify and concatenate javascript into one file. It will also compile css via less or whatever css preprocessor you have used
						in the project. This is also the step that you would compile CoffeeScript if you are using it.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Server</h2>
					<p>
						This task will start a simple html serving web server, that will autoreload any html/js/css upon change. Grunt-livereload is a great plugin to help
						with this.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Clean</h2>
					<p>
						This task will remove the compiled JS and css files form the project. It's sometimes nice to reset our app in order to avoid any wierd caching issues.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Test</h2>
					<p>
						This task will start a test runner in an interactive mode. Running the unit tests in chrome. I use testem but karma is also very popular. The test runner
						will monitor for changes in the tests and new tests being added. I try to use a practical version of TDD and having a continual running test enviroment
						really helps me have a solid work flow.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Test ci</h2>
					<p>
						This task runs tests in a headless manner that is useful for continous integration. This will use PhantomJS which is a headless webkit browser to run
						tests with out interaction.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="transitions">
					<h2>Mochai? Chai? really the coffee names have gone far enough</h2>
					<p>
						Mocha is a Unit testing library. It uses a BDD style syntax for it's testing descrtiptions. Here is the offical tag line:
						Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on node.js and the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun. Mocha tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting, while mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases.
						Chai is a testing syntax helper library used to specify a declaritive/promise based assertion syntax. Offical tag line:
						Chai is a BDD / TDD assertion library for node and the browser that can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section id="themes">
					<h2>BDD? assertations? say what!?</h2>
					<p>
						BDD - stands for Behavior driven development. Tests are written in a manner that reads like a sentence.
						In other words a test should read in this way
						<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
						test("the function getting data from the api", function(fixture_data) {
							//....do test stuff
						});
					</code></pre>
						Assertions look like this normally:
						<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
						a = 1;
						b = 2;
						assert(a == b, "This should have failed");
						// this print out the test in the second parameter
					</code></pre>
						Chai make it nicer but giving us this syntax:
						<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
						a = 1;
						b = 1;
						a.should.equal.b("This should not fail");
						//or
						expect(a).to.equal(b, 'This should not fail');
					</code></pre>
						So assertions are the indivual tests clauses of our greater tests suite.
